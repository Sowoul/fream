# Fream

# Background:
The program searches for matches for the entered keyword in fitgirl repacks, which, at this moment is the best website for repacks, in my opinion.  
Due to the compatibility issues experienced in my last project, this time, the project is coded to be accessible irrespective of the operating system.  
It should run perfectly across windows, linux, mac, as well as android and ios.  
  
# REQUIREMENTS:  
  utorrent, or any other magnet downloader  
   
# Steps:  
Download the depends.py and fream_final.py files, making sure that they are in the same directory.  
  
Simply open the fream_final file  

In the search box, type the name of the game you wish to download.    
  
Click on search, and wait. It should take about 2-3 seconds to scrap the results.  

You will be displayed three options, choose the one that best fits to your requirements, and select it.  
  
Now, you will be redirected to your torrent application with the downloading process started. (Allow upto 5 seconds after clicking on the option)  
   

The older files from earlier development stages of fream have also been included, to help understand the thinking that went into the development.  

And yes, the name is an amalgamation of the words free and steam.  

# Disclaimer:  
I, in no form encourage pirating of any form or size. This is an educational project made to sharpen my coding skills and serve as a guide to others who  
might embark on a similar course.
